The white flag is the original internationally recognized protective sign of truce or ceasefire, and request for negotiation. A white flag signifies to all that an approaching negotiator is unarmed, with an intent to surrender or a desire to communicate.\nThis standard for a digital white flag protocol, the Whiteflag Protocol, provides a reliable means for both combatant and neutral parties in conflict zones to digitally communicate pre-defined signs and signals using blockchain technology.

Whiteflag specification uses predefined signals and signs derived from International Humanitarian Law, the CRED Disaster Category Classification, and the OECD Economic Infrastructure Common Reporting Standard Codes. Future proposals will build up Fennel Protocol to accomodate the full extent of the Whiteflag Protocol specification. Substrate's interoperability will provide the Polkadot ecosystem with a shared conception of Whiteflag Protocol's predefined signals and signs; this will allow users to seemlessly send Whiteflag messages across the decentralized Polkadot ecosystem. Critically, an interoperable Whiteflag Network ensures situational awareness is not siloed but is unified in critical use cases. This helps decision makers receive a full picture of the field of operations. These predefined signs and signals provide an encoding standard for a wide range of protective signs, danger signs, and mission-critical signals.
