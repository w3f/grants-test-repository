Under the hood, a feed action is invoked with create lifecycle, which accepts the mandatory parameters the lifecycle, auth, trigger name, and other optional parameters of the event source. The feed action invokes the related actions of creating the entry in the database, adding to the Kafka consumer group, etc. The next component in the event trigger manager is a persistent connection to Kafka where it is used to produce and consume the stream of data.
