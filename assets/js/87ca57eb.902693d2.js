Therefore, the cost that users pay to generate Coinversation Stablecoin (cUSD) through collateral is determined by the relative change of all synthetic assets in the entire system, rather than artificial regulations in previous decentralized stablecoins (e.g. Dai). This cost is more market-oriented, and at the same time it is equivalent to the inflation rate of stablecoin to world assets.  In general, the stable currency cUSD and the synthetic asset issuance and contract exchanges in the Coinversation Protocol constitute a complete Defi system in the Polkadot ecosystem.
