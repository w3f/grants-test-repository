global decentralized cloud data storage platform \u2013 a blockchain-based network infrastructure that is transparent, efficient, and equal opportunity to all members of the global community. CESS encourages excess or under-utilized resources as nodes to join CESS\u2019s unrestricted expandable network via the token economy incentive method. Each node joins the CESS peer-to-peer network by contributing data storage resources, computational resources, or network bandwidth. Built on our state-of-the-art virtualization and cloud computing technologies, CESS organizes and manages the participating resources providing clients with secure, high performance, and boundless cloud data storage services. Furthermore, the CESS protocol enables interconnection of network nodes, to build a large decentralized cloud storage system that supports up to 100PB storage scale to meet the demand of enterprise level data storage. CESS will adopt a phased approach to implement the above goals."),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Indication 1: With the goal of entering Polkadot ecosystem, CESS will build a blockchain system based on Substrate directly, and plans to develop custom pallets on FRAME.
