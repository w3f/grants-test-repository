While many cryptocurrency enthusiasts have recognized this monetary revolution throughout the past decade, far less have discussed the crucial economic factor that sustains wealth over generations: inheritance, or, in this case, digital inheritance. "),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Digital inheritance emerged from the convergence of three previously separate worlds: wealth management, estate planning, and digital assets. Here, a digital asset is stored digitally, is uniquely identifiable, and has some value, such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs. So naturally, one of the central questions surrounding an individual\u2019s digital assets will relate to digital inheritance: How will individuals pass their cryptocurrencies and NFTs onto their beneficiaries once they pass away? This brings us to a foreseeable rise in digital asset executors, who will be responsible for administering an individual\u2019s last will and testament once they pass away and ensure that their digital assets are appropriately distributed to the relevant beneficiaries through, for example, smart contracts on the blockchain."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Despite the rise of digital asset executors, it would appear that, from a legal point of view, various challenges remain in the way of digital inheritance as being a reliable form of transmitting wealth across generations.
