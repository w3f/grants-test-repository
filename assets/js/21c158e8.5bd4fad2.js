Therefore, it might lead to many inconveniences for the users such as funds being transferred to the wrong address. In contrast, traditional payment is usually based on human-readable identifiers (HRI) instead of random strings, and this is for a good reason. There are many application scenarios that require the payment to be based on one's HRIs. When you pay your debts to your friends, you want the transaction record to be bound to your identity so that it can serve as proof later that your debt has been paid. Or if you take a business trip, you want your accommodation receipt to associate with your company's identifier so that you can reimburse the cost later. If you go to a grocery store to buy some daily goods, you want the transaction record to have your own identity on it to prove to the grocery cashier you have paid the bill. As a matter of fact, you can find countless examples that demonstrate that it is preferable to have your payment based on HRIs instead of random addresses. Cryptocurrency has already brought fundamental change to the existing financial system and internet economy. The emerging Web 3.0 is starting to give the user back the ownership and control of their data.

However, most of these naming services focuses specifically on providing HRIs for the users of one single blockchain ecosystem and fails to bridge the users of the different ecosystems and hence are against the "breaking the digital barriers" ethos of Web 3.0. Most importantly, the new HRI system fails to incorporate many existing Web 2.0 human-readable identifiers that users are more comfortable using in practice, such as their various social media identities, email addresses (based on which PayPal systems are built), etc. We believe it is far more interesting to build a cross-platform payment scheme based on a generic HRI system that combines the users\' existing Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 identifiers.'),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Different from the current internet economy that by and large is segmented by the digital wall garden erected by various internet monopoly companies, a cross-platform payment scheme will open up many interesting application scenarios that truly embody the spirit of Web 3.0.

If a Facebook user watches an advertisement on an estate NFT from Decentraland, he/she can pay for the NFT directly from his/her Facebook account via Faceless.

However, in order for the Cryptocurrency market to attract institutional money on a large scale, one has to address its regulatory concerns. The privacy issue is likely to play a central part in the regulatory compliance requirements. This has been demonstrated when Meta (previously Facebook) tried to launch its own cryptocurrency Diem (previously Libra).

The idea of identity-based encryption \\cite{Shamir84} was proposed by Adi Shamir as a replacement for the traditional public-key encryption scheme, which requires a public key infrastructure to verify the correspondence between a public key and the user's real identity. In an identity-based encryption scheme, the user's identity is treated as one's public key, and a user with a secret key corresponding to the respective identity can be used to decrypt the ciphertext encrypted under the respective identity. In other words, instead of using a random string as the user's public key, the IBE system treats HRI as the user's public key. Another interesting feature of the IBE system is that there exists a master key that can be used to derive as many as necessary secret keys corresponding to different identities. This feature enables a user in our proposed scheme to use a master key to derive multiple secret keys to manage the private payment of multiple HRIs. A layer-2 private payment scheme based on the IBE scheme will generate the ciphertext for the transferred balance under the receiver's identity, which could be any HRI owned by the receiver.

This is why we require the underlying IBE scheme to be anonymous, which implies that no useful information on the identity can be deduced from the ciphertext. Note each layer-1 account will manage one single set of public parameters and master key, which can be used to generate and manage multiple secret keys for multiple HRIs.

Here the encryption algorithm is the homomorphic Elgamal encryption scheme. The user can then fund the account by homomorphic adding b tokens to the encrypted balance. The tokens can also be transferred between two layer-2 accounts, the user needs to generate two ciphertexts of the transferred amount for both the sender and receiver's public keys respectively. Zether employs a zero-knowledge proof scheme to prove that the two ciphertexts encrypt the same amount and the remaining sender balance after the sent amount deduced from the original account is still positive. To guarantee the anonymity of the involved sender and receiver public keys, the Zether framework adopts a one-our-of-many zero-knowledge proof scheme to ensure the sender and receiver's public keys are hidden among the public keys of anonymity set.
