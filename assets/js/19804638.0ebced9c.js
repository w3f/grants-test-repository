This will help us to further extend our product portfolio and at the same time unlock a substantial amount of marketing budget in order to promote the usage of our tools within our supported ecosystems (like Polkadot). Hence by investing and launching our own professional commercial activities targeting developers and enterprises who potentially benefit from our tools, we will fuel the growth of the Polkadot ecosystem substantially.
