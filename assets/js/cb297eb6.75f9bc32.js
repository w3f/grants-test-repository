In addition to giving rewards to those who provide constructive contributions, Clover will encourage its third party developers to continuously build innovative dApps on top of Clover. Each project built on Clover by the third party developers will require a solid financial foundation, and generally donations from the community are insufficient to cover development expenses which results in stagnated growth. Therefore a sound funding mechanism has been established, The Developer Incentive Program, where all the projects building on Clover can benefit from a share of transaction fees. The Developer Incentive Program (DIP) is a Clover-native consensus feature that aims to direct a percentage of transaction fees to registered smart contracts to incentivize in Clover third party contract developers and commons, mainly to boost external dApp development which ultimately enlarges the Clover DeFi ecosystem overall. The program is consistent with Clover\u2019s properties of being a decentralized operating system which does not touch the inflation schedule or alter the scarcity of CLV, but effectively increases the security of smart contracts against bugs and software vulnerabilities by enabling external development to be properly funded. Overall the benefits of the plan create the potential for a very exciting future in which Clover can grow and compete, and can reach its goal of becoming the best possible DeFi platform for all.

Clover maintains its social media including Twitter, Youtube, Medium, and more to provide self-generated content, and covert followers and users to our Telegram, Discord, and Kakao groups. Marketing campaigns will be held to keep user activeness while Clover will focus on incentivizing users to participate in liquidity mining and governance activities. Key metrics of campaigns include the number of new user growth, the number of token holders, the number of members in the developer and the overall community, social media followers, total value locked (on liquidity mining applications), and number of votes."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
