He has published more than 60 academic papers in cryptography and blockchain technologies at leading venues for research in IT Security and Cryptography. He frequently serves in program committees of prestigious conferences including Eurocrypt, IEEE S&P and NDSS. For his work he received multiple awards including the Eurocrypt\u201914 best paper award and the DFG/FNP Copernicus prize 2020. His main scientific contributions to the blockchain space are the co-invention of the concept of Proofs of Space (on which the cryptocurrency Chia is based), the first formal analysis of BIP32 wallets, and extensive work on off-chain protocols. The latter includes the development of the Perun off-chain protocols published in a series of works at IEEE S&P, Eurocrypt and ACM CCS. These publications form the mathematical foundations for the Perun software development project that is currently funded by a BMBF grant for founding high-tech companies in the IT Security space.

He then joined a software development startup for one year, finally starting a PhD in computer science at TU Darmstadt in the field of secure multi-party computation, which he is about to complete.
