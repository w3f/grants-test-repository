The idea originally came to the team leader, Kevin Zhang, seven years ago when working as the CTO of iHealthLabs. Utilizing patients' health data for scientific research while preventing health data breaches has always been a major problem. He initially tried to solve the dilemma using blockchain but realized that the existing blockchain technologies were far too slow to be practical. He then decided to add the root of trust alongside existing blockchain cryptography + consensus. This is the hardware root of trust. TEA uses existing mature Trusted Computing technologies to provide secure computing services to client blockchains without requiring specialized CPU features such as Phala's (TEE) Intel SGX CPU or Bitcoin's ASIC CPU. Besides the Tensorflow demo app on TEA, making a practical crypto wallet can demonstrate how TEA can do better, so they started the Gluon.
