The module records and analyzes user transaction characteristics based on a counter, and uploads to the blockchain when abnormal results emerge from the analysis. When a potentially abnormal transaction occurs, the user can choose, based on advance configuration, whether the module simply alerts when an abnormal transaction is reported, or freezes the account until the user comes to deal with the problem on their own.
